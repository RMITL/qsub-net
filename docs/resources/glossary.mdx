# Glossary

## A

### Alpha (α)
Returns above a benchmark. In QUANTA, "alpha" refers to excess risk-adjusted returns generated by signal generators.

### α-Token
QUANTA's native token, used for staking, governance, and competition participation. Symbol: α or ALPHA. Total supply: 100,000,000.

### Ante
The stake amount signal generators put up to participate in the competition pot. Proportional to position exposure.

## B

### Bittensor
A decentralized machine learning network where QUANTA operates as a subnet. Provides TAO token emissions and Yuma consensus.

### Burn
Permanent removal of tokens from circulation. In QUANTA, 50% of forfeited antes are burned.

## C

### Calmar Ratio
A risk-adjusted performance metric: Annual Return ÷ Maximum Drawdown. Higher is better.

### Coldkey
A Bittensor wallet's primary key for high-security operations. Should be kept offline.

### Commit-Reveal
A two-phase submission process that prevents front-running. First commit a hash of your portfolio, then reveal the actual positions.

### Consensus
Agreement among validators on signal scores. QUANTA uses Yuma consensus with κ=0.67 threshold.

### Composite Score
The final weighted score combining all metrics: Sortino (35%), Calmar (25%), Max Drawdown (25%), Turnover (15%).

## D

### dTAO
Dynamic TAO allocation mechanism in Bittensor that adjusts subnet emissions based on performance.

### Downside Deviation
Standard deviation of negative returns only. Used in Sortino ratio calculation.

### Drawdown
The peak-to-trough decline in portfolio value. Maximum drawdown is the largest such decline.

## E

### Emission
Distribution of new tokens. QUANTA has two emission types: TAO from Bittensor and α-tokens from the protocol.

### Epoch
A time period in the QUANTA network. 1-hour epochs for submissions, daily epochs for settlements.

### Evaluation Window
Time periods over which signals are scored: 7 days (20%), 30 days (35%), 90 days (45%).

## G

### Gross Exposure
Sum of absolute position weights. A portfolio with 80% long and 50% short has 130% gross exposure.

### Governance
The process by which α-token holders vote on protocol parameters and upgrades.

## H

### Hotkey
A Bittensor wallet's operational key for daily transactions. Can be on live servers.

## L

### Long Position
A bet that a stock will increase in value. Represented as positive weight.

## M

### Market Neutral
A portfolio strategy with equal long and short exposure, resulting in zero net market exposure.

### Maximum Drawdown
The largest peak-to-trough decline in portfolio value over a period.

### Miner
In QUANTA, a signal generator who submits portfolio recommendations. Different from traditional proof-of-work miners.

### Multiplier
A bonus factor applied to top performers. Rank #1 receives 5x multiplier on rewards.

## N

### Net Exposure
Sum of position weights (longs minus shorts). A market-neutral portfolio has 0% net exposure.

### Normalization
The process of scaling scores to a common range (0-1) for comparison and combination.

## P

### Pool Operator
An entity that aggregates signals from multiple generators and presents them to validators, taking a fee for the service.

### Portfolio
A collection of stock positions with associated weights. QUANTA evaluates complete portfolios, not individual picks.

### Position
A stake in a single security. Includes the ticker, weight (direction and size).

## R

### Rake
The network's fee taken from the competition pot before distribution. Currently 8%.

### Rebalancing
Adjusting portfolio weights, either due to price movements or strategy updates.

### Risk-Adjusted Return
Returns normalized by some measure of risk, such as volatility or drawdown.

### Rolling Window
An evaluation period that continuously moves forward, always covering the most recent N days.

## S

### Short Position
A bet that a stock will decrease in value. Represented as negative weight.

### Signal
A portfolio recommendation submitted by a generator. Contains ticker-weight pairs.

### Signal Pool
QUANTA's mechanism for accepting unlimited signals despite Bittensor's 256 UID limit.

### Slashing
Penalty applied to validators for misbehavior (e.g., consensus deviation, downtime).

### Sortino Ratio
A risk-adjusted metric: (Return - Risk-Free Rate) ÷ Downside Deviation. Unlike Sharpe, only penalizes downside risk.

### Stake
Tokens locked as collateral. Required for both signal submission (α-tokens) and validation (TAO + α-tokens).

### Subnet
A specialized network within Bittensor. QUANTA operates as subnet SN-X.

## T

### TAO
Bittensor's native token. Flows to QUANTA through subnet emissions.

### Turnover
A measure of trading frequency. High turnover incurs costs and penalties.

## U

### UID
Unique Identifier in a Bittensor subnet. Limited to 256 per subnet.

### Universe
The set of tickers that can be included in signals—any ticker for which validators can provide a price feed.

## V

### Validator
A network participant who evaluates signals, maintains consensus, and distributes rewards.

### Vesting
A schedule by which tokens become available over time. Team tokens vest over 2 years.

## W

### Weight
The proportion of a portfolio allocated to a position. Positive for long, negative for short.

### Winsorization
Capping extreme values at a percentile to reduce outlier impact on statistics.

## Y

### Yuma Consensus
Bittensor's consensus mechanism using stake-weighted scoring and κ threshold for agreement.
