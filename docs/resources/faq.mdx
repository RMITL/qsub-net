# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is QUANTA?">
    QUANTA (Quantitative Autonomous Network for Trading Alpha) is a decentralized network for generating and validating stock market signals. It's built on Bittensor and rewards participants for submitting high-quality, risk-adjusted trading signals.

    Think of it as a global competition where anyone can submit trading strategies and earn rewards based on actual performance.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Getting Started

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I start submitting signals?">
    1. Install the QUANTA CLI: `pip install quanta-cli`
    2. Create a wallet: `quanta wallet create --name mywallet`
    3. Get testnet tokens: `quanta faucet request --wallet mywallet`
    4. Submit your first signal

    See the [Quickstart Guide](/guides/quickstart) for detailed steps.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need to run a server?">
    **No** — You can participate as a Pool Participant with just a wallet.

    **Yes** — If you want to run as a Direct Miner (holds your own UID) or Validator.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How much does it cost to participate?">
    | Role | Cost |
    |------|------|
    | Pool Participant | α-token stake only (e.g., 10-20 α per signal) |
    | Direct Miner | TAO for UID registration + α-token stakes |
    | Validator | TAO stake (1,000+) + α-token stake (10,000+) + server costs |
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between testnet and mainnet?">
    | Aspect | Testnet | Mainnet |
    |--------|---------|---------|
    | Tokens | Fake (from faucet) | Real value |
    | Data | May use synthetic data | Real market data |
    | Purpose | Learning/testing | Real rewards |

    Always test on testnet first!
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Signals & Scoring

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What format should my signal be in?">
    A JSON object mapping tickers to weights:

    ```json
    {
      "AAPL": 0.10,
      "MSFT": 0.08,
      "TSLA": -0.05
    }
    ```

    Positive = long, negative = short. See [Signal Format](/reference/signal-format) for details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How are signals scored?">
    Six metrics, weighted:

    | Metric | Weight | Measures |
    |--------|--------|----------|
    | Sharpe | 40% | Risk-adjusted returns (primary) |
    | Total P/L | 20% | Absolute return performance |
    | Max Drawdown | 15% | Worst peak-to-trough loss |
    | Sortino | 10% | Return per downside risk |
    | Calmar | 10% | Return vs max drawdown |
    | Turnover | 5% | Trading frequency penalty |

    See [Scoring Methodology](/concepts/scoring) for formulas.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why is Sharpe the primary metric?">
    Sharpe ratio is the industry standard for comparing risk-adjusted returns across strategies:

    - Used by every major hedge fund and asset manager
    - Enables apples-to-apples comparison
    - Captures the fundamental risk-reward tradeoff

    Sortino and Calmar provide refinements (downside-only volatility, drawdown focus) as secondary metrics.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How often can I update my signal?">
    - **Minimum interval**: 1 hour between updates
    - **Recommended**: Daily or weekly (lower turnover = better score)

    High-frequency updates incur turnover penalties.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if my signal performs poorly?">
    - **Bottom 30%**: Forfeit your stake (50% burned, 50% to winners)
    - **Break-even tier (25%)**: Get your stake back
    - **Profitable (35%)**: Stake back + bonus
    - **Top 10%**: Stake back + premium bonus

    You can always withdraw and try again with a new strategy.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Tokens & Economics

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between TAO and α-tokens?">
    | Token | Purpose |
    |-------|---------|
    | **TAO** | Bittensor native token; emissions flow from network |
    | **α-token** | QUANTA native token; staking, governance, competition |

    You earn both as a signal generator. Validators primarily earn TAO + α-token staking rewards.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I get α-tokens?">
    1. **Earn through mining**: Submit signals and earn rewards
    2. **Buy on DEX**: α/TAO pair on supported exchanges
    3. **Ecosystem grants**: Apply for validator/developer grants
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What determines my rewards?">
    Your rewards depend on:
    1. **Your score** relative to other signals
    2. **Your stake** (higher stake = higher conviction = bigger potential win/loss)
    3. **Your rank** (top performers get multipliers)
    4. **Total network emissions** (varies based on Bittensor allocation)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is the α-token deflationary?">
    Yes, through burns:
    - 50% of forfeited antes are permanently burned
    - With 30% of signals forfeiting each epoch, this creates steady deflation

    Total supply is fixed at 100M; circulating supply decreases over time.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Technical

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is the Signal Pool?">
    The Signal Pool is QUANTA's innovation to overcome Bittensor's 256 UID limit. It allows unlimited signal generators to submit portfolios by separating signal submission from miner identity.

    See [Signal Pool](/concepts/signal-pool) for the full explanation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does commit-reveal work?">
    1. **Commit**: Submit a hash of your portfolio (hides positions)
    2. **Wait**: Commit window closes (prevents front-running)
    3. **Reveal**: Submit actual portfolio (must match hash)

    This prevents others from copying your signal before it's evaluated.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What data sources are used?">
    Validators use approved data sources:
    - **Primary**: Polygon.io
    - **Backup**: Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance

    All validators use the same source to ensure consistent scoring.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is consensus reached?">
    QUANTA uses Bittensor's Yuma consensus with κ=0.67:
    1. Each validator submits scores independently
    2. Scores are weighted by validator stake
    3. Final score = stake-weighted median where agreement > 67%

    Validators deviating significantly from consensus face penalties.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Validators

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What do validators do?">
    Validators:
    1. Fetch market data from approved sources
    2. Simulate portfolio performance
    3. Calculate scoring metrics
    4. Submit scores to consensus
    5. Distribute rewards

    They're the infrastructure backbone of the network.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How much can validators earn?">
    Validators receive 41% of TAO emissions plus α-token staking rewards:
    - **TAO APY**: Varies based on stake weight and network emissions
    - **α APY**: Target 12-18% on staked α-tokens

    Actual earnings depend on stake size and consensus alignment.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are the hardware requirements?">
    | Component | Minimum | Recommended |
    |-----------|---------|-------------|
    | CPU | 8 cores | 16+ cores |
    | RAM | 32 GB | 64+ GB |
    | Storage | 500 GB NVMe | 1 TB NVMe |
    | Network | 1 Gbps | 10 Gbps |
    | Uptime | 99% | 99.9%+ |
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Risk & Safety

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What are the risks of participating?">
    **Signal Generators:**
    - Stake loss if signals underperform
    - Market risk (strategies may fail in certain conditions)

    **Validators:**
    - Slashing for consensus deviation or downtime
    - Infrastructure costs

    **All:**
    - Smart contract risk (mitigated by audits)
    - Token price volatility
    - Regulatory uncertainty
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I protect my wallet?">
    - Use hardware wallet for coldkey
    - Keep hotkey separate from coldkey
    - Never share mnemonic/seed phrase
    - Backup to multiple secure locations
    - Use strong, unique passwords
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Are the smart contracts audited?">
    Audits are planned before mainnet launch. Current status:
    - SignalPool: Planned
    - AlphaToken: Planned
    - RewardDistributor: Planned

    Use testnet until audits are complete.
