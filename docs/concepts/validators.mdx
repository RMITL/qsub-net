# Validators

Validators are the backbone of QUANTA. They run the infrastructure that evaluates signals, reaches consensus on performance, and distributes rewards fairly.

## Role Overview

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="What Validators Do" icon="shield-check">
    Fetch market data, simulate portfolios, score signals, participate in consensus
  </Card>
  <Card title="What Validators Earn" icon="coins">
    41% of TAO emissions + α-token staking rewards
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Market Data Acquisition

Validators independently fetch price data for the approved universe:

```python
# Daily data fetch
for ticker in APPROVED_UNIVERSE:
    prices[ticker] = fetch_ohlcv(ticker, source=PRIMARY_SOURCE)

    # Cross-validate with secondary source
    prices_backup = fetch_ohlcv(ticker, source=SECONDARY_SOURCE)
    assert abs(prices[ticker] - prices_backup) < TOLERANCE
```

<Info>
Validators must use approved data sources to ensure consistency across the network.
</Info>

### 2. Signal Evaluation

For each signal in the pool, validators simulate portfolio performance:

```python
def evaluate_signal(signal, price_data, window_days):
    # Simulate portfolio returns
    portfolio_returns = []

    for day in range(window_days):
        daily_return = sum(
            signal.weights[ticker] * price_data[ticker].returns[day]
            for ticker in signal.weights
        )
        portfolio_returns.append(daily_return)

    # Calculate risk-adjusted metrics
    return {
        "sortino": sortino_ratio(portfolio_returns),
        "calmar": calmar_ratio(portfolio_returns),
        "max_drawdown": max_drawdown(portfolio_returns),
        "turnover": calculate_turnover(signal)
    }
```

### 3. Composite Scoring

Validators compute a weighted composite score:

| Metric | Weight | Direction |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Sortino Ratio | 35% | Higher is better |
| Calmar Ratio | 25% | Higher is better |
| Max Drawdown | 25% | Lower is better |
| Turnover Penalty | 15% | Lower is better |

```python
def composite_score(metrics):
    return (
        0.35 * normalize(metrics["sortino"]) +
        0.25 * normalize(metrics["calmar"]) +
        0.25 * normalize(-metrics["max_drawdown"]) +  # Invert
        0.15 * normalize(-metrics["turnover"])        # Invert
    )
```

### 4. Consensus Participation

Validators submit scores to Yuma consensus:

```python
# Submit scores to consensus
for signal_id, score in scores.items():
    consensus.submit_weight(
        miner_uid=signal_id,
        weight=score,
        validator_signature=sign(score)
    )

# Consensus threshold: κ = 0.67
# Scores are accepted if 67%+ of validators agree
```

## Validator Economics

### TAO Rewards

Validators receive 41% of subnet emissions (same as miners):

```
Validator_TAO = Stake_Weight × Consensus_Alignment × 0.41 × Epoch_Emissions
```

Where:
- **Stake Weight:** Proportion of total validator stake
- **Consensus Alignment:** How closely your scores match consensus

### α-Token Staking

Validators must stake α-tokens to participate:

| Stake Tier | Minimum Stake | Benefits |
|------------|---------------|----------|
| Standard | 10,000 α | Basic participation |
| Enhanced | 50,000 α | Priority in consensus |
| Premium | 100,000+ α | Governance voting rights |

<Note>
Staked α-tokens earn yield from protocol fees and can be slashed for malicious behavior.
</Note>

### Slashing Conditions

Validators can lose staked tokens for:

| Violation | Penalty |
|-----------|---------|
| Incorrect scores (>10% deviation from consensus) | 1% stake |
| Extended downtime (>24 hours) | 0.5% stake |
| Data manipulation (proven) | 100% stake |
| Collusion (proven) | 100% stake |

## Running a Validator

### Hardware Requirements

| Component | Minimum | Recommended |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| CPU | 8 cores | 16+ cores |
| RAM | 32 GB | 64+ GB |
| Storage | 500 GB NVMe | 1 TB NVMe |
| Network | 1 Gbps | 10 Gbps |
| Uptime | 99% | 99.9%+ |

### Setup Overview

```bash
# Clone QUANTA validator repo
git clone https://github.com/RMITL/QUANTA
cd QUANTA/validator

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure wallet
btcli wallet create --wallet.name validator_wallet

# Register as validator
btcli subnet register --netuid X --wallet.name validator_wallet

# Start validator
python validator.py \
    --wallet.name validator_wallet \
    --data.provider polygon \
    --netuid X
```

## Evaluation Pipeline

### Multi-Horizon Windows

Validators evaluate each signal over three time horizons:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="7-Day Window (20%)" icon="bolt">
    **Purpose:** Capture recent alpha, detect regime changes

    ```python
    short_term_score = evaluate_signal(signal, window=7)
    ```

    - Most responsive to new information
    - Higher variance
    - Weight: 20%
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="30-Day Window (35%)">
    **Purpose:** Balance responsiveness with noise reduction

    ```python
    medium_term_score = evaluate_signal(signal, window=30)
    ```

    - Moderate responsiveness
    - Moderate variance
    - Weight: 35%
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="90-Day Window (45%)">
    **Purpose:** Reward consistency, penalize one-hit wonders

    ```python
    long_term_score = evaluate_signal(signal, window=90)
    ```

    - Least responsive
    - Lowest variance
    - Weight: 45%
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Transaction Cost Modeling

Validators apply realistic transaction costs:

```python
def apply_transaction_costs(signal, turnover):
    # Base spread: 5 bps
    spread_cost = turnover * 0.0005

    # Market impact: scales with position size
    impact_cost = turnover * estimate_market_impact(signal.position_sizes)

    # Commission: 0.5 bps
    commission = turnover * 0.00005

    total_cost = spread_cost + impact_cost + commission
    return signal.returns - total_cost
```

## Consensus Mechanics

### Yuma Consensus

QUANTA uses Bittensor's Yuma consensus with κ = 0.67:

```
1. Each validator submits scores for all signals
2. Scores are stake-weighted and aggregated
3. Final score = median of scores where validator stake > threshold
4. Rewards distributed based on final scores
```

### Consensus Alignment

Your rewards depend on alignment with consensus:

```python
alignment = 1 - abs(your_score - consensus_score) / consensus_score

# Perfect alignment → 100% of base reward
# 5% deviation → 95% of base reward
# 10%+ deviation → slashing risk
```

<Warning>
Validators significantly out of consensus face slashing. Ensure your data sources and scoring implementation match specifications.
</Warning>
