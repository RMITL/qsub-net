# Scoring Methodology

QUANTA uses a sophisticated multi-metric scoring system designed to reward genuine alpha generation while penalizing excessive risk-taking and gaming.

## Philosophy

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Risk-Adjusted" icon="shield">
    Raw returns don't matter—risk-adjusted returns do
  </Card>
  <Card title="Consistency" icon="chart-line">
    Long-term performance weighted more than short-term
  </Card>
  <Card title="Realistic" icon="scale-balanced">
    Transaction costs and turnover matter
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Composite Score

The final score is a weighted combination of six metrics:

```
Composite = 0.40 × Sharpe + 0.20 × PnL + 0.15 × (1 - MaxDD) + 0.10 × Sortino + 0.10 × Calmar + 0.05 × (1 - Turnover)
```

| Metric | Weight | What It Measures |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| Sharpe Ratio | 40% | Risk-adjusted returns (industry standard) |
| Total P/L % | 20% | Absolute return performance |
| Max Drawdown | 15% | Largest peak-to-trough decline |
| Sortino Ratio | 10% | Return per unit of downside risk |
| Calmar Ratio | 10% | Return relative to worst drawdown |
| Turnover Penalty | 5% | Trading frequency cost |

## Sharpe Ratio (40%)

The Sharpe ratio is the **primary metric** and industry standard for risk-adjusted returns.

### Formula

```
Sharpe = (R_p - R_f) / σ

Where:
- R_p = Portfolio return
- R_f = Risk-free rate (Treasury rate)
- σ = Standard deviation of portfolio returns
```

### Why Sharpe is Primary

Sharpe is the universal benchmark for comparing investment performance:
- Used by every major hedge fund and asset manager
- Enables apples-to-apples comparison across strategies
- Captures the fundamental risk-reward tradeoff

### Interpretation

| Sharpe | Quality |
|--------|---------|
| < 0 | Losing money |
| 0-0.5 | Below average |
| 0.5-1.0 | Acceptable |
| 1.0-2.0 | Good |
| 2.0-3.0 | Excellent |
| > 3.0 | Outstanding |

## Total P/L % (20%)

Absolute return performance matters—raw profit and loss.

### Formula

```
P/L % = (V_n - V_0) / V_0 × 100

Where:
- V_n = Final portfolio value
- V_0 = Initial portfolio value
```

### Why Include P/L?

While risk-adjusted metrics are primary, absolute returns still matter:
- Investors ultimately care about dollar gains
- Ensures strategies actually make money
- Prevents gaming through extreme low-volatility strategies

## Maximum Drawdown (15%)

Maximum drawdown measures the worst-case loss from any peak.

### Formula

```
MaxDD = max((Peak_i - Trough_j) / Peak_i) for all i < j
```

### Why It Matters

<Warning>
A 50% drawdown requires a 100% gain to recover. Drawdown asymmetry makes capital preservation critical.
</Warning>

| Drawdown | Recovery Required |
|----------|-------------------|
| 10% | 11% |
| 20% | 25% |
| 30% | 43% |
| 50% | 100% |

### Interpretation

| Max Drawdown | Quality |
|--------------|---------|
| Less than 10% | Excellent |
| 10-15% | Good |
| 15-25% | Acceptable |
| Greater than 25% | Concerning |

## Sortino Ratio (10%)

The Sortino ratio refines Sharpe by only penalizing **downside** volatility.

### Formula

```
Sortino = (R_p - R_f) / σ_d

Where:
- σ_d = Downside deviation (std dev of negative returns only)
```

### Why Sortino?

Sortino answers a key question: upside volatility isn't bad! A strategy that swings +5%, +15%, +8% has high volatility but zero downside risk.

### Interpretation

| Sortino | Quality |
|---------|---------|
| Less than 1 | Below average |
| 1-2 | Good |
| 2-3 | Excellent |
| Greater than 3 | Outstanding |

## Calmar Ratio (10%)

The Calmar ratio relates return to the worst-case scenario.

### Formula

```
Calmar = Annual Return / Max Drawdown
```

<Info>
Calmar answers: "For every 1% I could lose in the worst case, how much do I expect to earn?"
</Info>

### Interpretation

| Calmar | Quality |
|--------|---------|
| Less than 0.5 | Poor risk/reward |
| 0.5-1.0 | Acceptable |
| 1.0-2.0 | Good |
| Greater than 2.0 | Excellent |

## Turnover Penalty (5%)

High turnover generates transaction costs that erode returns.

### Formula

```
Turnover = Σ|w_t - w_{t-1}| / 2

Monthly Turnover Penalty = min(Turnover / 0.50, 1.0)

Where:
- w_t = Portfolio weights at time t
- 0.50 = Reference turnover (50% monthly = 600% annual)
```

### Transaction Cost Model

```python
# Realistic transaction costs
def total_cost(turnover, avg_position_size):
    spread = 0.0005  # 5 bps
    impact = 0.0002 * sqrt(avg_position_size / ADV)  # Market impact
    commission = 0.00005  # 0.5 bps

    return turnover * (spread + impact + commission)
```

### Interpretation

| Monthly Turnover | Quality | Approx Annual Cost |
|------------------|---------|-------------------|
| < 10% | Excellent | < 1.2% |
| 10-20% | Good | 1.2-2.4% |
| 20-40% | Acceptable | 2.4-4.8% |
| 40-60% | High | 4.8-7.2% |
| > 60% | Excessive | > 7.2% |

## Multi-Horizon Weighting

Metrics are calculated over three windows and combined:

```
Final_Metric = 0.20 × Metric_7d + 0.30 × Metric_30d + 0.50 × Metric_90d
```

### Why Multiple Horizons?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="7-Day (20%)" icon="bolt">
    **Captures:** Recent alpha, regime changes, news-driven performance

    **Risk:** High variance, easily gamed

    **Role:** Early signal of strategy breakdown or breakthrough
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="30-Day (35%)" icon="calendar">
    **Captures:** Medium-term performance, seasonal patterns

    **Risk:** Moderate variance

    **Role:** Balance between responsiveness and stability
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="90-Day (45%)" icon="calendar-check">
    **Captures:** Long-term consistency, strategy robustness

    **Risk:** Low variance, slow to respond

    **Role:** Prevent one-hit wonders, reward sustainable alpha
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Score Normalization

Raw metrics are normalized to [0, 1] range for combination:

```python
def normalize(values, metric_type):
    if metric_type in ["sortino", "calmar"]:
        # Higher is better
        return (values - values.min()) / (values.max() - values.min())
    else:
        # Lower is better (drawdown, turnover)
        return 1 - (values - values.min()) / (values.max() - values.min())
```

### Outlier Handling

Extreme values are winsorized to prevent single signals from dominating:

```python
def winsorize(values, lower=0.01, upper=0.99):
    return values.clip(
        lower=values.quantile(lower),
        upper=values.quantile(upper)
    )
```

## Example Calculation

Let's score a signal:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Calculate Raw Metrics">
    | Metric | 7-Day | 30-Day | 90-Day |
    |--------|-------|--------|--------|
    | Sortino | 2.5 | 1.8 | 1.5 |
    | Calmar | 3.0 | 2.2 | 1.8 |
    | MaxDD | 8% | 12% | 15% |
    | Turnover | 15% | 18% | 20% |
  </Step>
  <Step title="Horizon-Weight Each Metric">
    ```
    Sortino = 0.20 × 2.5 + 0.30 × 1.8 + 0.50 × 1.5 = 1.79
    Calmar = 0.20 × 3.0 + 0.30 × 2.2 + 0.50 × 1.8 = 2.16
    MaxDD = 0.20 × 8% + 0.30 × 12% + 0.50 × 15% = 12.7%
    Turnover = 0.20 × 15% + 0.30 × 18% + 0.50 × 20% = 18.4%
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Normalize (assume network ranges)">
    ```
    Sortino_norm = (1.79 - 0.5) / (3.0 - 0.5) = 0.52
    Calmar_norm = (2.16 - 0.5) / (3.5 - 0.5) = 0.55
    MaxDD_norm = 1 - (12.7% - 5%) / (30% - 5%) = 0.69
    Turnover_norm = 1 - (18.4% - 5%) / (50% - 5%) = 0.70
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Compute Composite">
    ```
    Composite = 0.35 × 0.52 + 0.25 × 0.55 + 0.25 × 0.69 + 0.15 × 0.70
             = 0.182 + 0.138 + 0.173 + 0.105
             = 0.598
    ```

    **Final Score: 59.8 out of 100**
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Anti-Gaming Measures

### Minimum Performance Thresholds

Signals must meet minimum thresholds to receive rewards:

| Metric | Minimum |
|--------|---------|
| Sortino | > 0 (profitable) |
| MaxDD | < 35% |
| Track Record | 7+ days |

### Correlation Penalties

Signals correlated with existing top performers receive reduced scores:

```python
if correlation_with_top_10 > 0.8:
    score *= 0.5  # 50% penalty
elif correlation_with_top_10 > 0.6:
    score *= 0.8  # 20% penalty
```

<Note>
This encourages diverse strategies rather than copycat signals.
