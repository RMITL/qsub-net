# Miners (Signal Generators)

In QUANTA, "miners" are signal generators who submit portfolio recommendations to the network. Unlike traditional proof-of-work mining, QUANTA miners compete on the quality of their trading signals.

## Role Overview

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="What Miners Do" icon="chart-line">
    Generate and submit portfolio signals (stock picks with weights)
  </Card>
  <Card title="What Miners Earn" icon="coins">
    TAO emissions + α-tokens based on risk-adjusted performance
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Miner Taxonomy

QUANTA supports multiple types of signal generators:

### Direct Miners

Hold their own UID and submit signals directly to validators.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Requirements | UID registration + validator connectivity |
| Control | Full control over signal submission |
| Rewards | 100% of earned rewards (no pool fees) |
| Best For | Serious quant traders with infrastructure |

### Pool Participants

Submit signals to the Signal Pool without holding a UID.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Requirements | α-token stake only |
| Control | Signal submission, no UID management |
| Rewards | ~85% of earned rewards (pool operator takes fee) |
| Best For | Individual traders, beginners, strategy testers |

### Pool Operators

Run infrastructure to aggregate signals from pool participants.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Requirements | UID registration + pool infrastructure |
| Control | Aggregation strategy, participant selection |
| Rewards | 15% fee on participant rewards |
| Best For | Infrastructure providers, community leaders |

## Signal Generation

### Portfolio Format

Miners submit weighted portfolios over the approved universe:

```python
portfolio = {
    "AAPL": 0.10,   # 10% long Apple
    "MSFT": 0.08,   # 8% long Microsoft
    "TSLA": -0.05,  # 5% short Tesla
    "NVDA": 0.12,   # 12% long Nvidia
    # ... up to 500 positions
}

# Constraints:
# - Sum of |weights| ≤ 2.0 (max 200% gross exposure)
# - Each |weight| ≤ 0.20 (max 20% per position)
# - Only approved universe tickers
```

### Strategy Types

QUANTA welcomes diverse strategies:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Momentum" icon="chart-line">
    **Idea:** Winners keep winning, losers keep losing

    ```python
    # Simple momentum signal
    momentum_12m = returns_12_month.rank()
    momentum_1m = returns_1_month.rank()

    signal = momentum_12m - momentum_1m  # 12-1 momentum
    portfolio = normalize_to_weights(signal)
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Value" icon="scale-balanced">
    **Idea:** Cheap stocks outperform expensive ones

    ```python
    # Simple value signal
    earnings_yield = earnings / market_cap
    book_to_market = book_value / market_cap

    signal = (earnings_yield.rank() + book_to_market.rank()) / 2
    portfolio = normalize_to_weights(signal)
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Market Neutral" icon="equals">
    **Idea:** Long best stocks, short worst stocks, zero market exposure

    ```python
    # Market neutral portfolio
    signal = your_alpha_signal()

    longs = signal.nlargest(50)
    shorts = signal.nsmallest(50)

    portfolio = concat([
        normalize(longs, target=1.0),
        normalize(shorts, target=-1.0)
    ])
    # Net exposure ≈ 0
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Multi-Factor" icon="layer-group">
    **Idea:** Combine multiple signals for diversification

    ```python
    # Multi-factor composite
    momentum = calculate_momentum()
    value = calculate_value()
    quality = calculate_quality()
    low_vol = calculate_low_volatility()

    composite = (
        0.30 * momentum.rank() +
        0.25 * value.rank() +
        0.25 * quality.rank() +
        0.20 * low_vol.rank()
    )

    portfolio = normalize_to_weights(composite)
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Reward Mechanics

### TAO Emissions

Miners receive 41% of subnet TAO emissions, distributed by performance:

```
Miner_TAO = (Miner_Score / Sum_All_Scores) × 0.41 × Epoch_Emissions

Example:
- Your score: 100
- Total network score: 10,000
- Epoch emissions: 10 TAO

Your TAO = (100 / 10,000) × 0.41 × 10 = 0.041 TAO
```

### α-Token Rewards

Additional α-token rewards from the competition pot:

| Performance Tier | Ante Result | Share of Winner Pool |
|------------------|-------------|---------------------|
| Top 10% | Returned + Premium | 50% of total pool |
| Profitable (45%) | Returned + Bonus | 40% of total pool |
| Break-even (25%) | Returned | 10% of total pool |
| Bottom 20% | Forfeited | 0% |

<Info>
50% of forfeited antes are burned (deflationary), 50% go to the winner pool.
</Info>

### Reward Multipliers

Top performers earn bonus multipliers:

| Rank | Multiplier |
|------|------------|
| #1 | 5.0x |
| Top 5 | 3.0x |
| Top 10% | 2.0x |
| Top 25% | 1.5x |
| Others | 1.0x |

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Backtest Thoroughly" icon="flask">
    Test your strategy on historical data before risking capital
  </Card>
  <Card title="Manage Risk" icon="shield">
    Keep position sizes reasonable; avoid concentrated bets
  </Card>
  <Card title="Diversify Signals" icon="chart-pie">
    Multiple uncorrelated signals reduce variance
  </Card>
  <Card title="Monitor Drawdowns" icon="arrow-trend-down">
    Maximum drawdown heavily impacts your score
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

<Warning>
**Overfitting:** Strategies that work perfectly on historical data often fail live. Use out-of-sample testing.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**High Turnover:** Excessive trading incurs transaction costs and turnover penalties. Target < 20% monthly turnover.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Copying Signals:** Highly correlated signals receive correlation penalties. Be original.
</Warning>

## Hardware Requirements

For direct miners:

| Component | Minimum | Recommended |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| CPU | 4 cores | 8+ cores |
| RAM | 16 GB | 32+ GB |
| Storage | 100 GB SSD | 500 GB NVMe |
| Network | 100 Mbps | 1 Gbps |
| Uptime | 95% | 99%+ |

Pool participants have no hardware requirements beyond a wallet.
