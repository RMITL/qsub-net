# QUANTA

**Quantitative Autonomous Network for Trading Alpha**

QUANTA is a Bittensor subnet that creates a decentralized marketplace for stock market signals. Think of it as a global competition where anyone can submit trading strategies and earn rewards based on how well they perform.

## The Big Picture

Traditional quantitative trading is dominated by hedge funds with massive resources. QUANTA levels the playing field by:

1. **Removing barriers** — No minimum capital, no credentials required
2. **Rewarding skill** — Your returns speak for themselves
3. **Enabling scale** — Unlimited participants through the Signal Pool
4. **Ensuring fairness** — Transparent, on-chain evaluation

## Key Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Target Market | $45T U.S. Equities |
| Precedent | Numerai: $550M AUM, 25% returns (2024) |
| Signal Universe | Any ticker with price feed |
| Evaluation Windows | 7, 30, 90 days |

## How It Compares

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="vs. Traditional Hedge Funds">
    Hedge funds require $1M+ minimums and exclusive access. QUANTA is permissionless — submit signals from anywhere, anytime.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="vs. Numerai">
    Numerai pioneered crowdsourced quant signals but uses centralized execution. QUANTA is fully decentralized on Bittensor with transparent on-chain rewards.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="vs. Prediction Markets">
    Prediction markets like Polymarket focus on binary outcomes. QUANTA evaluates complete portfolios with risk-adjusted metrics.

## Built on Bittensor

QUANTA operates as a subnet in the [Bittensor](https://bittensor.com) network, inheriting:

- **TAO emissions** — Native token rewards from the network
- **Yuma consensus** — Decentralized agreement on signal quality
- **64+ validators** — Distributed infrastructure for reliability
- **Cryptographic verification** — Tamper-proof performance tracking
