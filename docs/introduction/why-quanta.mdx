# The Problem

Quantitative trading generates billions in profits every year, but the opportunity is locked behind massive barriers.

## The Current State

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="$1M+ Minimums" icon="lock">
    Most quant funds require million-dollar minimums to invest
  </Card>
  <Card title="Exclusive Access" icon="building">
    Top strategies are hoarded by institutions with proprietary data
  </Card>
  <Card title="Zero Transparency" icon="eye-slash">
    No way to verify actual performance or methodology
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Who Wins Today?

The quantitative trading industry is dominated by a handful of players:

| Fund | AUM | Annual Returns | Access |
|------|-----|----------------|--------|
| Renaissance Medallion | $10B+ | 66% (gross) | Employees only |
| Two Sigma | $60B | 15-20% | Institutional |
| D.E. Shaw | $60B | 12-18% | High net worth |

**The pattern is clear:** The best returns go to those who already have capital and connections.

## The Opportunity

What if anyone could compete?

The alternative data market is exploding — projected to grow from **$9.28B in 2024** to **$635B by 2034** (52.6% CAGR). This growth is driven by:

- Satellite imagery
- Social sentiment
- Web scraping
- IoT data
- Transaction data

<Info>
**Numerai proved the model works.** Their crowdsourced quant fund achieved $550M AUM and 25% returns in 2024, with 5,000+ data scientists competing globally.

## The QUANTA Solution

QUANTA removes every barrier while adding something new: **skin in the game**.

### 1. Permissionless Entry

No credentials. No minimums. No gatekeepers.

```
Anyone with a trading thesis can submit signals.
Anyone with capital can stake and validate.
```

### 2. Meritocratic Rewards

Your signals are evaluated purely on risk-adjusted performance:

- **Sortino Ratio** — Downside risk matters more than volatility
- **Calmar Ratio** — Returns relative to maximum drawdown
- **Maximum Drawdown** — How much could you lose?
- **Turnover Penalty** — Excessive trading costs money

### 3. Transparent Verification

Every signal, every evaluation, every reward is recorded on-chain:

- Cryptographic proof of submission timing
- Public performance leaderboards
- Verifiable reward distribution

### 4. Aligned Incentives

QUANTA's dual revenue model ensures everyone has skin in the game:
