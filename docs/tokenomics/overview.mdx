# Tokenomics Overview

QUANTA operates with a dual-token model that combines Bittensor's native TAO with QUANTA's native α-token to create aligned incentives across all participants.

## Two Tokens, One Network

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="TAO (Bittensor)" icon="coins">
    Native Bittensor token providing sustainable emissions and network security
  </Card>
  <Card title="α-Token (QUANTA)" icon="circle-dollar">
    Native QUANTA token for staking, governance, and competition participation
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## TAO: The Foundation

### What TAO Provides

| Function | Benefit |
|----------|---------|
| Emissions | Sustainable rewards without external capital |
| Staking | Validator security and alignment |
| Network Effects | Connection to Bittensor ecosystem |
| Liquidity | Established markets and liquidity |

### TAO Flow in QUANTA

```mermaid
graph TB
    ROOT[Bittensor Root Network] -->|Dynamic Allocation| QUANTA[QUANTA Subnet]
    QUANTA -->|41%| MINERS[Signal Generators]
    QUANTA -->|41%| VALIDATORS[Validators]
    QUANTA -->|18%| OWNER[Subnet Owner]
```

## α-Token: The Incentive Layer

<Note>
Like all Bittensor subnets, QUANTA's α-token follows Bittensor's dTAO tokenomics: **21 million maximum supply** with a halving emission schedule mirroring TAO. This is a protocol-level constraint—subnet founders cannot modify emission rates or supply caps.
</Note>

### Core Functions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Staking" icon="lock">
    **Validators:** Must stake minimum 2,000 α to participate in consensus

    **Signals:** Proportional stake required based on position exposure

    ```
    Signal stake = Gross exposure × Base rate
    Validator stake = 2,000 α minimum
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Competition Ante" icon="trophy">
    Signal generators stake α-tokens to participate in the competition pot:

    - Winners earn redistributed stakes from losers
    - Bottom performers forfeit their ante
    - Creates real "skin in the game"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Governance" icon="gavel">
    α-token holders vote on protocol parameters:

    - Scoring metric weights
    - Evaluation window durations
    - Emission schedules
    - Universe composition
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Fee Discounts" icon="percent">
    Stake α-tokens for reduced fees:

    - API access tiers
    - Premium analytics
    - Priority processing
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Token Supply

### α-Token Emission (Bittensor dTAO)

QUANTA's α-token follows Bittensor's standard subnet emission model:

| Property | Value | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Maximum Supply | 21,000,000 α | Hard cap (same as TAO) |
| Initial Emission | ~2 α/block | Protocol-controlled |
| First Halving | ~10.5M α minted | ~50% of supply |
| Halving Schedule | Mirrors TAO | Predictable deflation |

<Info>
Unlike traditional token launches, Bittensor subnet α-tokens are emitted by the protocol based on network activity—not pre-minted or allocated by founders. The emission rate is determined by Bittensor's consensus mechanism.
</Info>

### Emission Distribution

All α-token emissions flow through Bittensor's standard distribution:

| Recipient | Share | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Signal Generators (Miners) | 41% | Performance-based rewards |
| Validators | 41% | Infrastructure and consensus |
| Subnet Owner | 18% | Protocol development |

### Supply Projection

```
Year 1: ~3-4M α circulating (early emission phase)
Year 2: ~6-8M α circulating
Year 3: ~9-11M α circulating
Year 4+: Approaching halving, emission rate decreases
Max: 21M α (hard cap, never exceeded)
```

## Value Accrual

### How α-Token Captures Value

<Steps>
  <Step title="Staking Demand">
    Validators must stake α to earn TAO emissions. More validators = more demand.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Performance Correlation">
    Protocol revenue used for buybacks when network hits performance targets.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Burn Mechanism">
    50% of forfeited antes are burned, reducing supply over time.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Governance Premium">
    Control over multi-million dollar parameter decisions creates governance value.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Deflationary Mechanics

```python
# Each epoch
forfeited_antes = sum(antes from bottom 20% performers)
burned = forfeited_antes * 0.50  # Permanent supply reduction

# Over time
cumulative_burn = sum(burned per epoch)
effective_supply = total_supply - cumulative_burn
```

<Info>
With the bottom 20% of signals forfeiting antes each epoch and 50% burn rate, significant supply reduction occurs over time.

## Token Utility Summary

| Use Case | Requirement | Benefit |
|----------|-------------|---------|

| Vote on governance | Any α holdings | Protocol control |
| API premium tier | 200+ α staked | Reduced fees, priority |
| Liquidity provision | LP tokens | LP rewards + fees |

## Economic Flywheel

The dual-token model creates a self-reinforcing cycle:

```
Better Signals → Higher Network Returns → More TAO Emissions
                                              ↓
                                         More Validators
                                              ↓
                                      More α Staking Demand
                                              ↓
                                        Higher α Value
                                              ↓
                                    More Signal Generators
                                              ↓
                                       Better Signals
```
