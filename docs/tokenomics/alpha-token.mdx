# α-Token (Alpha Token)

The α-token is QUANTA's native token, designed to create economic alignment between signal quality and network value.

## Token Basics

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Name | QUANTA Alpha Token |
| Symbol | α (or ALPHA) |
| Total Supply | 100,000,000 |
| Decimals | 18 |
| Chain | Bittensor (Substrate) |
| Initial Circulation | 15,000,000 (15%) |

## Core Utility

### 1. Signal Staking

Required to submit signals to the network:

```python
# Stake requirement
required_stake = gross_exposure × BASE_RATE

# BASE_RATE = 10 α per 100% exposure
# 100% long portfolio → 10 α
# 150% long-short → 15 α
# 200% leveraged → 20 α
```

<Info>
Stakes are locked during signal evaluation and serve as skin-in-the-game collateral.
</Info>

### 2. Validator Staking

Validators must stake α-tokens to participate:

| Tier | Stake Required | Benefits |
|------|----------------|----------|
| Standard | 10,000 α | Basic validation rights |
| Enhanced | 50,000 α | Priority in consensus |
| Premium | 100,000+ α | Governance voting weight |

### 3. Competition Participation

α-tokens are the currency of the competition pot:

- **Ante:** Proportional stake required
- **Winnings:** Redistributed from underperformers
- **Losses:** Forfeited if bottom 30%

### 4. Governance

Token holders vote on protocol parameters:

### 5. Fee Discounts

Stake α-tokens for reduced platform fees:

| Stake Amount | API Discount | Analytics Discount |
|--------------|--------------|-------------------|
| 100 α | 10% | 5% |
| 1,000 α | 25% | 15% |
| 10,000 α | 50% | 30% |
| 100,000+ α | 75% | 50% |

## Emission Schedule

### Miner Emissions (40M α)

Performance-based emissions over 4 years:

```python
# Yearly emission (approximate)
year_1 = 16_000_000  # 40%
year_2 = 12_000_000  # 30%
year_3 = 8_000_000   # 20%
year_4 = 4_000_000   # 10%
total  = 40_000_000  # 100%

# Per-epoch emission
daily_year_1 = 16_000_000 / 365 ≈ 43,836 α/day
```

### Emission Decay

```
Year 1: ████████████████  16M α (40%)
Year 2: ████████████       12M α (30%)
Year 3: ████████           8M α (20%)
Year 4: ████               4M α (10%)
```

### Top Performer Multipliers

| Rank | Multiplier | Example (1000 α base) |
|------|------------|----------------------|
| #1 | 5.0× | 5,000 α |
| #2-5 | 3.0× | 3,000 α |
| Top 10% | 2.0× | 2,000 α |
| Top 25% | 1.5× | 1,500 α |
| Others | 1.0× | 1,000 α |

## Value Accrual

### Staking Demand

As the network grows, more α must be staked:

```python
# Validator staking demand
validator_demand = num_validators × avg_stake
# 64 validators × 50,000 α = 3,200,000 α

# Signal staking demand
signal_demand = num_signals × avg_exposure × base_rate
# 1000 signals × 150% × 10 α = 1,500,000 α

# Total locked
total_locked = validator_demand + signal_demand
# = 4,700,000 α (4.7% of supply)
```

### Burn Mechanics

50% of forfeited antes are permanently burned:

```python
# Daily burn estimate
daily_signals = 1000
forfeit_rate = 0.30  # Bottom 30%
avg_stake = 15

forfeited = daily_signals × forfeit_rate × avg_stake
# = 4,500 α forfeited daily

burned = forfeited × 0.50
# = 2,250 α burned daily

annual_burn = burned × 365
# = 821,250 α burned annually (~0.8% of supply)
```

### Protocol Revenue

Protocol revenue supports token value:

| Source | Use |
|--------|-----|
| Network Rake (8%) | 20% to buybacks |
| API Subscriptions | 10% to buybacks |
| Premium Features | Ecosystem fund |
