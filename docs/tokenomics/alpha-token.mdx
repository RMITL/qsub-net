# α-Token (Alpha Token)

The α-token is QUANTA's subnet-specific token on Bittensor, following the dTAO (Dynamic TAO) tokenomics model. Like all Bittensor subnet tokens, it creates economic alignment between signal quality and network value.

## Understanding Bittensor Alpha Tokens

<Note>
Every Bittensor subnet has its own "alpha token" (α). QUANTA's α-token is not unique in structure—it follows the same protocol-level constraints as all other subnet tokens. What makes each subnet's α-token valuable is the utility and quality of the subnet itself.
</Note>

## Token Basics

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Name | QUANTA Alpha Token |
| Symbol | α (or ALPHA) |
| Maximum Supply | 21,000,000 |
| Decimals | 18 |
| Chain | Bittensor (Substrate) |
| Emission Model | dTAO (protocol-controlled) |

<Info>
The 21 million cap mirrors TAO itself and is a protocol-level constraint. Subnet founders cannot modify supply caps or arbitrarily mint tokens—all emissions are controlled by Bittensor's consensus mechanism.
</Info>

## Core Utility

### 1. Signal Staking

Required to submit signals to the network:

```python
# Stake requirement
required_stake = gross_exposure × BASE_RATE

# BASE_RATE = 10 α per 100% exposure
# 100% long portfolio → 10 α
# 150% long-short → 15 α
# 200% leveraged → 20 α
```

<Info>
Stakes are locked during signal evaluation and serve as skin-in-the-game collateral.
</Info>

### 2. Validator Staking

Validators must stake α-tokens to participate:

| Tier | Stake Required | Benefits |
|------|----------------|----------|
| Standard | 2,000 α | Basic validation rights |
| Enhanced | 10,000 α | Priority in consensus |
| Premium | 50,000+ α | Governance voting weight |

### 3. Competition Participation

α-tokens are the currency of the competition pot:

- **Ante:** Proportional stake required
- **Winnings:** Redistributed from underperformers
- **Losses:** Forfeited if bottom 20%

### 4. Governance

Token holders vote on protocol parameters:

| 250 α | 25% | 15% |
| 1,000 α | 50% | 30% |
| 5,000+ α | 75% | 50% |

## Token Emission (dTAO Model)

### How Bittensor Alpha Emission Works

Unlike traditional token launches with pre-allocated supplies, Bittensor subnet α-tokens are **emitted by the protocol** based on network activity:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         21,000,000 α (Maximum Cap)          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
           │
           ├── Emitted via protocol (~2 α/block initially)
           │
           ├── Halving when ~10.5M α minted
           │
           └── Distribution per emission:
               ├── 41% → Signal Generators (Miners)
               ├── 41% → Validators
               └── 18% → Subnet Owner
```

<Warning>
There is no "team allocation" or "ecosystem fund" in the traditional sense. All α-tokens come from protocol emissions distributed to network participants. The subnet owner receives 18% of ongoing emissions, which can fund development.
</Warning>

### Emission Schedule

Bittensor controls emission rates at the protocol level:

| Phase | Emission Rate | Cumulative Supply |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|
| Launch | ~2 α/block | 0 → ~10.5M |
| Post-Halving 1 | ~1 α/block | 10.5M → ~15.75M |
| Post-Halving 2 | ~0.5 α/block | 15.75M → ~18.4M |
| Asymptotic | Decreasing | Approaching 21M |

### Daily Emission Estimates

```python
# At launch (~2 α/block, ~7200 blocks/day)
daily_emission = 2 × 7200 = ~14,400 α/day

# Distribution per day:
miners_daily = 14,400 × 0.41 = ~5,900 α
validators_daily = 14,400 × 0.41 = ~5,900 α
owner_daily = 14,400 × 0.18 = ~2,600 α
```

### Top Performer Multipliers

| Rank | Multiplier | Example (100 α base) |
|------|------------|----------------------|
| #1 | 5.0× | 500 α |
| #2-5 | 3.0× | 300 α |
| Top 10% | 2.0× | 200 α |
| Top 25% | 1.5× | 150 α |
| Others | 1.0× | 100 α |

## Value Accrual

### Staking Demand

As the network grows, more α must be staked:

```python
# Validator staking demand
validator_demand = num_validators × avg_stake
# 64 validators × 5,000 α = 320,000 α

# Signal staking demand
signal_demand = num_signals × avg_exposure × base_rate
# 1000 signals × 150% × 10 α = 15,000 α

# Total locked
total_locked = validator_demand + signal_demand
# = 335,000 α (~1.6% of max supply)
```

### Burn Mechanics

50% of forfeited antes are permanently burned:

```python
# Daily burn estimate
daily_signals = 1000
forfeit_rate = 0.20  # Bottom 20%
avg_stake = 10

forfeited = daily_signals × forfeit_rate × avg_stake
# = 2,000 α forfeited daily

burned = forfeited × 0.50
# = 1,000 α burned daily

annual_burn = burned × 365
# = 365,000 α burned annually (~1.7% of max supply)
```

<Info>
Because emissions are ongoing but finite (approaching 21M), and burns are permanent, the effective circulating supply will plateau and potentially decrease over time as burn rate exceeds emission rate in later phases.
</Info>

### Protocol Revenue

Protocol revenue supports token value:

| Source | Use |
|--------|-----|
| Network Rake (8%) | 20% to buybacks |
| API Subscriptions | 10% to buybacks |
| Premium Features | Ecosystem fund |

## Acquiring α-Tokens

### How dTAO Trading Works

Bittensor's dTAO system creates automatic markets for subnet α-tokens:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Stake TAO in Subnet">
    When you stake TAO in QUANTA subnet, you receive α-tokens from the subnet's liquidity pool.

    ```
    Stake TAO → Receive α at current exchange rate
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Earn Through Participation">
    Submit signals or run validators to earn α-token emissions

    ```
    No purchase required
    Earn based on performance
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Unstake to TAO">
    Convert α-tokens back to TAO via the subnet's AMM pool

    ```
    Unstake α → Receive TAO at current rate
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Ongoing Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Mining | Submit high-quality signals, earn 41% of emissions |
| Validating | Run validator infrastructure, earn 41% of emissions |
| Staking | Stake TAO in subnet to receive α-tokens |
| LP Rewards | Provide liquidity in α/TAO pools |

## Token Security

### Smart Contract

<Warning>
Smart contracts will be audited before mainnet. Until audit completion, use testnet only.
</Warning>

| Security Measure | Status |
|------------------|--------|
| External Audit | Planned |
| Bug Bounty | Active (testnet) |
| Multisig Treasury | 3/5 threshold |
