# Dual Revenue Model

QUANTA's economic model uniquely combines two revenue streams: a competition pot (ante redistribution) and TAO emissions. This dual approach solves problems that either mechanism alone cannot.

## The Problem with Single Models

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Prize Pool Only">
    **Issues:**
    - Winners take all → losers leave
    - No infrastructure incentive (validators unpaid)
    - Network thins over time
    - Only top performers stay

    **Example:** Poker tournaments without rake share
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Emissions Only">
    **Issues:**
    - Participation trophy effect
    - No skin in the game
    - Sybil vulnerability (fake identities)
    - Quality signals not rewarded enough

    **Example:** Airdrops to inactive wallets
  </Tab>

## The QUANTA Solution

| Component | Purpose | Solves |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Competition Pot | Reward genuine alpha | Quality incentives |
| TAO Emissions | Sustain participation | Infrastructure + long tail |
| Combined | Performance + sustainability | Self-sustaining network |

## Competition Pot (Ante System)

### How It Works

Every signal submission requires a proportional stake:

```python
# Stake calculation
required_stake = gross_exposure × base_rate × conviction_multiplier

# Examples:
# 100% exposure, 1x conviction → 10 α
# 150% exposure, 2x conviction → 30 α
# 200% exposure, 1x conviction → 20 α
```

### Pot Distribution Flow

### Distribution by Tier

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Bottom 20% (Forfeit)" icon="arrow-trend-down">
    **What happens:** Entire stake is forfeited

    **Where it goes:**
    - 50% permanently burned (deflationary)
    - 50% added to winner pool

    **Example:** 20 signals × 15 α avg = 300 α
    - 150 α burned
    - 150 α to winners
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Break-even 25% (Return)" icon="equals">
    **What happens:** Original stake returned

    **No gain, no loss**

    **Example:** 25 signals each receive their original stake back
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Profitable 45% (Bonus)" icon="arrow-trend-up">
    **What happens:** Original stake + share of winner pool

    **Pool share:** 40% of winner pool ÷ 45 signals

    **Example:**
    - Winner pool: 150 α
    - Profitable share: 60 α
    - Per signal: 60 ÷ 45 = 1.3 α bonus
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Top 10% (Premium)" icon="trophy">
    **What happens:** Original stake + premium share + multipliers

    **Pool share:** 50% of winner pool ÷ 10 signals

    **Example:**
    - Winner pool: 150 α
    - Top tier share: 75 α
    - Per signal: 7.5 α bonus (before multipliers)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Network Rake

The 8% rake serves multiple purposes:

| Use | Percentage | Purpose |
|-----|------------|---------|
| Protocol Treasury | 50% | Development funding |
| Insurance Fund | 30% | Slashing coverage |
| Buybacks | 20% | α-token value support |

## TAO Emissions

### Why Emissions Matter

Emissions provide sustainable baseline rewards:

```
Without Emissions:
- Only winners earn
- Validators have no incentive
- Long-tail generators leave
- Network becomes whale competition

With Emissions:
- Everyone earns something
- Validators are compensated
- Long-tail stays engaged
- Network remains diverse
```

### Emission Distribution

| Recipient | Share | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Signal Generators | 41% | Performance rewards |
| Validators | 41% | Infrastructure incentive |
| Subnet Owner | 18% | Protocol development |

### Performance-Weighted Distribution

TAO to miners is weighted by performance score:

```python
def distribute_tao_to_miners(scores, miner_tao_pool):
    total_score = sum(scores.values())

    rewards = {}
    for miner, score in scores.items():
        weight = score / total_score
        rewards[miner] = weight * miner_tao_pool

    return rewards
```

## Combined Economics

### Example: Full Epoch Calculation

**Setup:**
- 100 active signals
- Average stake: 15 α (total pot: 1,500 α)
- Daily TAO emission: 10 TAO

**Step 1: Competition Pot**
```
Pot: 1,500 α
Rake (8%): 120 α → treasury
Net pot: 1,380 α

Bottom 20% forfeit: 300 α
  → Burned: 150 α
  → Winners: 150 α

Distribution:
- Bottom 20 (20 signals): 0 α each
- Break-even (25 signals): 15 α each (returned)
- Profitable (45 signals): 15 + 1.3 = 16.3 α each
- Top 10 (10 signals): 15 + 7.5 = 22.5 α each
```

**Step 2: TAO Emissions**
```
Total TAO: 10 TAO
Miner pool: 4.1 TAO

Top performer (score: 200/1000): 0.82 TAO
Average performer (score: 100/1000): 0.41 TAO
Below-average (score: 50/1000): 0.205 TAO
```

**Step 3: Combined Rewards (Top Performer)**
```
TAO: 0.82 TAO × $400 = $328
α-token: 26.25 α × $1 = $26.25

Total: $354.25 (from 15 α stake)
ROI: 175% (for this epoch)
```

## Economic Simulations

### Scenario: High Competition

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Active signals | 1,000 |
| Average stake | 20 α |
| Total pot | 20,000 α |
| Bottom 20% forfeit | 4,000 α |
| Daily burn | 2,000 α |
| Annual burn | ~730K α (0.73% of supply) |

### Scenario: Low Competition

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Active signals | 100 |
| Average stake | 10 α |
| Total pot | 1,000 α |
| Bottom 20% forfeit | 200 α |
| Daily burn | 100 α |
| Annual burn | ~36.5K α (0.04% of supply) |

<Info>
Higher competition = more burn = stronger deflationary pressure. The system self-balances.
